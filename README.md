# Banks_incentive_offers
This project aims to understand what factors drive banks to use dollar incentive offers (e.g., a $200 bonus for depositing $3,000) to attract deposits. Two examples are given in the links below:

# Datasets:
The data is unavailable but is described in detail below.
(A)	A dataset including banks’ promotional offers, named “DatasetA.csv”
We have three identifiers in the dataset, Primary Company (which is often a bank), Campaign ID, and Observation ID. For each Primary Company, there might be multiple Campaigns in a month. Within each Campaign, there could be multiple incentives. For example:
Primary Company     Campaign ID       	          Incentive Text    	Observation ID
Bank A                    	Campaign a              	Incentive 1               	1
Bank A                    	Campaign a              	Incentive 2               	2
Bank A                    	Campaign b              	Incentive 3               	3
(B)	A dataset including banks’ quarterly financial variables, named “DatasetB.csv”. You do not need to make use of all the variables.

# Objectives:
 Explore what factors drive banks to use incentive offers and investigate whether some macroeconomic variables, such as the Fed funds rate, are also influential.
